## What is the UCSD Food Cooperative?

The UCSD Food Cooperative is a non-hierarchical student run organization that serves vegan meals daily to the greater UCSD community. Alongside vegan meals made in the space, we serve food from vendors such as sambusas, drinks such as kombucha and coconut water, and basic needs supplies. All of the work is volunteer based, so any profits we make go right back into the space.
